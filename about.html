  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <br>
  <p>We know that overcoming homelessness often means more than a roof over your head. That’s why the Homeless Helpline supports people to work their way out of homelessness, providing meaningful work as well as a stable home for as long as someone
    needs it.</p>
  <br>
  <p> Our mission is to draw upon our core values - community, kindness and compassion - to make our society a better place for everyone who lives in it. Homeless Helpline aims to reduce homelessness globally by changing the way we approach the
    issue: reducing stigmas, and spreading awareness about how to help.
    Our website has two sections - one for those in need, and one for those to help. That way, whoever you are, whatever you want to do, we’re here to give advice and support you every step of the way. </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Our Values</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Every person deserves respect and aid against injustice</li>
    <li>To be honest in what we do</li>
    <li>To empower citizens to help those in need</li>
    <li>To help those who need it most</li>
  </ul>
